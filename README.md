# P-99 Ruby
These are my solutions to P-99 Prolog Problems <a href= https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/index.html>[Link to website with problems]</a> I wrote using Ruby language with testing file.
This is something I'm currently working on, trying to improve my programming skills.
