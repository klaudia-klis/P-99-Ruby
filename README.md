# P-99 Ruby
These are my solutions to P-99 Prolog Problems <a href= https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/index.html>(Website with problems)</a> I wrote using Ruby language with testing file.
That's something I'm currently working on, trying to improve my programming skills.

Currently 34/99.
